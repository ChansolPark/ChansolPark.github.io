Q. 
</h2>

What is your favorite video game developer, and which company would you like to work for, and why ?

<br>

<h2>
A. 
</h2>

My favorite video game developer is Iwata Satoru of nintendo. Because nintendo always make no stressful games. The most of all games of nintendo are very easy to learn and has simple control for interaction. So many familys or friends are playing the game when they're in a home party. also when I went to my home in busan. I always play the nintendo with my young sister. she's younger then me 8'years but we always playing fun. 
And i love ther're ideas. I think the rule is really difficult to make a fun. as i say the nintendo game's must be easy to learn, simple control and could be every generation love it. but new one always make me feel interest and want to play it. cut to the chase (is it make sence..?? pls tell me). this is why my favorite developer is Iwata Satoru. this spirit must be came from his Values. But the answer of question two is not nintendo. nintendo is second.

I'm gonna tell you my first. first is bungie. Actually it was bllizard, But as you know bllizard disappointed us many times. So my first is changed. bungie's games are has big scale and good story. Let me add, I think a game is next level of movie. Because when we watching a movies, We can just only watch it. that's it. But in games, We can intervene. Sometimes, Endings changed becuase of my action. Or We can join a battlefields, sometimes we survive in a world got zombie birus. yes ! possibility of game is infinity ! this is why i decide to be a game developer and my goal is work in big company, Not for money, for make games of good quality and big scale. So bungie's make me high !

My answers end. I hope you felt interest for this post. and have a good day :)
