How do you fell about famous people behaving poorly in public

<br>

<h2>
A. 
</h2>

When famous people got trouble. I'm trying to not judge them. Because they are just same person like us. So I think it's must be judged by law only. not emotionally. judging emotionally is make the case to witch hunt.
