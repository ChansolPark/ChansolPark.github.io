<br>

A. 
</h2>

I think because of uncertainy situation of covid-19. When we watch a disaster movie, most of all, there's a panic buying scenes. So I think Why ammo prices went up in 20 ~ 21 is similarly with movie. Not only ammo, I heard almost prices went up in Covid-19. I think People When getting uncertainy situation they're move on for peace of mind. Like prepare ammo for protect one's family from other, Or prepare food for getout starvation. So I think this is why ammo prices went up in 20 - 21.
