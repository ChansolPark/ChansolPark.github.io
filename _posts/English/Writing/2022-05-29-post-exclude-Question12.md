Q11) Do you think that VR is the future of entertainment? Why or why not?"

<br>

<h2>
A. 
</h2>

Conclusion is VR is the future of entertainment. 

When I was in college I made a VR Game for G-STAR Festival. You can see My games to this link. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRIRTkO1yWk&list=PLWYsunbpXNGRIMU59N76fSbLPdkcHLKA4) What I felt when I making thoes games Was VR games are too difficult to design a game. Because there is some kind of restrictions. First one is must be no **Frame Drop**. Frame Drop makes player feel Motion Sickness. Second one is no movement in game as possible. Movement can be make Motion Sickness too. By now maybe you realized VR Game is Sensitive about Motion Sickness. Also no movement in a game is really difficult to be fun. So I was really got tired because of desine a game. So I think VR Tech being most use platform, Firstable is implement the movement in a game. But I think implemeting a movement in vr game is future technology. **So that's why I think "VR is the future of entertainment"**
