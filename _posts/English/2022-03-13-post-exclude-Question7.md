A.

I think there'no what i can do. As you said It doesn't matter how I feel. It's just he's decision. However I'll be sad.. because I can't see a grand daughter.. But i'm gonna say "Good Luck ! And be take you life to happy." And support them like present to them a PlayStation6. Wait.. It's super cool ! I can play a game, football with them (could be adopted sons too) And they must be win a fight of family to family ! But if fight each other.. must be start by nose bleeding or could be more. whatever it's he's life so I hope just he happy.
